hi
my name is minsu i am 25 years old and my major is software, currently in junior year.

let me talk about my childhood first
i was born in changwon, gyeongsangnamdo at 1996. at my age of 11, my family moved to china, because my father was told to go by 
the company he was working for. In china i learned some english at the international school, and ironically i did not learn any chinese when i was there.
At my age of 16, my family moved back to korea, and this time to seoul. and from then, I am living in seoul until now.

my hobby is mostly related to sports, i like to play and watch baseball, basketball, football games. but my favorite hobby is playing computer games,
alone in my room.

Traveling is also my hobby. i've been to different countries such as china, taiwan, hongkong, and macau. And my favorite one was macau.
I enjoyed to play in the casino, even if i couldn't earn any money thorugh it. Also the local foods in macau were great. Especially egg tart tasted awesome.

thank you for listening

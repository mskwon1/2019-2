# Introduction of Embedded Systems

## Embedded Systems

- Traditional Definition
  - Systems with hardware and software for special-purposes with customized designs
  - Systems whose sub-components are CPUs, memory, I/O, and other specialized components with customized software stacks are running
- Convergence of GP(General Purpose) and embedded systems
  - The line between embedded systems and GP systems blurred
  - Issues shared between two platforms
    - Performance
    - Power consumption
    - Use of operating systems

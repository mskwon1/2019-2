## Memory Systems

### Embedded HW Structure

![1569129861454](C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1569129861454.png)

### Role

- Workspace for computer programs
- Permanent storage for programs and data

### Abstraction of memory

- Virtually **flat** memory space
  - A single **logical address space** from an application perspective
  - **Assume** an ideal memory : read/write any location in 1 CPU clock

### Implementation

- **Impossible** to implement using a single type of memory device
- A well-implemented **"Memory Hierarchy"**
- Composed of a set of memory **subsystems**
  - Caches, DRAMs, disks, tapes, distribtued file systems, etc.

### Goal

- Simultaneously achieve **speed & capacity**
  - Speed : to provide toe performance of the fastest component
  - Capacity : At a cost of the cheapest component

### Locality of reference

- The key to memory hierarchy design

### Memory Taxonomy

![1569130290483](C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1569130290483.png)

#### SRAM(Static RAM)

- 4T or 6T Strutcure (T = Transistor)
- **Volatile** : Data is lost when not powered
- **Stable** : Holds value as long as power applied
- Very **fast** (~tens of ns) : Suitable for L1 and L2 caches
- Very **expensive** : Typical size range : tens of Kbits ~ several Mbits

#### DRAM(Dynamic RAM)

- 1T1C Structure (C = Capacitor) : The charge gradually leaks off
- **Volatile** : Data is lost when not powered
- **Unstable** : Data is lost without a periodic refresh
- **Destructive read** (charge consumed by read) : Must rewrite after read
- **Fast** (~hundreds of ns) : Suitable for main memory
- Very **Expensive** : Typical size range : several **Gbits**

#### Flash Memory

- **Operation principle**
  - Electrons trapped in the floating gate
- **Nonvolatile**
  - Electrons remain without power supply
  - Can be removed when high voltage supplied(erase operation)
- **Read/Write(Program) Unit**
  - Page (1KB ~ 4KB)
- **Erase Unit** : Block tens of pages
- **Out-place update**
  - Erase-before write constraint
  - Requires garbage collection

#### Multi-Level Cell Flash

- Store **two or more bits per cell**

  - Fine-grained control of the amount of charge to be stored

- Features

  - Lower **cost-per-bit**
  - Slower **program speed**
  - Slower **read speed**
  - Decreased **write endurance**
  - Decreased **data retention time**

### Cache Memory

- A **small size & high speed** memory
  - stores a part of frequently used data
- Most of memory accesses hit in the cache
  - Provide lower average memory access time
  - Exploit temporal & spatial localities

![1569758101057](C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1569758101057.png)

### Cache Performance

- Design goal
  - supply instructions and data to the CPU as fast as possible
- Cache hit
  - requested data found in the cache
  - hit time : access latency for data in the cache
- Cache miss
  - requested data not found in the cache
  - miss penalty : elapsed time to fetch the missed cache line from main memory (line fill)
- Average access time
  - access time = hit time + miss rate * miss penalty

### Cache Writing Policy

- Write Hit
  - Write Through
    - Write is done both to the cache and to the main memory
  - Write Back
    - Write is done only to the cache
    - Main memory is updated when the associated cache block is evicted from the cache
      (lazy write)
- Write Miss
  - Write Allocate
    - Missed cache block is first loaded to the cache, followed by a write-hit operation
  - No-wrtie Allocate
    - Missed cache block is not loaded to the cache
    - Data is directly written to the main memory

### MMU(Memory Management Unit)

- Address Translation
  - Convert virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses
- Memory Protection
  - To prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it

### Memory Controller

- Role
  - Manage the flow of data going to and from the main memory
- Functions
  - Address decode
    - Determine a target memory device
    - Assert a proper memory control signal (chip select)
  - Address multiplexing (for DRAM)
    - Split a given address into row and column address
    - Same address pins used to feed both ROW and COL addresses
  - Refresh operation (for DRAM)
    - Periodic read and write of every memory cells

## I/O Devices

- Similar to memory devices
  - use of address bus, data bus, and control signals
- I/O-mapped I/O (or port-mapped I/O)
  - Dedicated address space for I/O devices
  - ex) intel X86
- Memory-mapped I/O
  - The same address bus for both memory and I/O devices
  - Typically used for most embedded processors
  - Caution
    - I/O memory region should be configured to be "non-cacheable"
    - I/O variables should be declared as "volatile"

### I/O Resource Management

- Polling
  - Continuously check the readiness of an I/O device in a synchronous manner
  - CPU does nothing other than waiting (busy-wait)
- Interrupt
  - Allow an I/O device to send a signal for its readiness
  - CPU can run other processes
- DMA (Direct Memory Access)
  - Data transfer between I/O devices and memory without intervention of the CPU

### Interrupt Interface

- Interrupt controller

  - manage interrupt requests from I/O devices

### Interrupt Flow Control

![1569760145871](C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1569760145871.png)

### Interrupt Vector

- Interrupt vector table
  - memory space for storing information to associate an interrupt handler function to an interrupt request
- Fixed Interrupt
  - the address for interrupt handler is fixed
- Vectored Interrupt
  - The address for interrupt handler is configurable
  - Can be set by I/O devices

### DMA (Direct Memory Access)

- Data can be transferred between I/O devices and memory without intervention of the CPU

  ![1569760245594](C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1569760245594.png)

### Bus

- A set of signals shared by the components in a computer system
- Used to transfer address, data, and control information between components
- Consist of address bus, data bus, and control bus
